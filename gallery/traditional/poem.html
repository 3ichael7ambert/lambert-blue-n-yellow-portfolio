Young Alive and so carefree<br>
Living outside, in this big city<br>
All day I spend with friends<br>
Having fun, until the end<br>

Feeling alive, and the whole worl'ds mine<br>

Cherish it all, and make them last<br>

Cherish it all, you will miss them so<br>

Looking for love, as if she'll find me<br>
Party-ing, to get this through<br>
The hardships, of life and the new<br>
Graduating and Have my degree<br>
With my friends, I can see<br>
That some did last, but most have changed<br>
But these memories will never change<br>

Treasure these moments, as they go by fast<br>
Cherish it all, and make them last<br>
Treasure these moments, as you grow<br>

Falling in love, and finding the one<br>
Seems so long, but I finally won<br>
With a kid here, in not too long<br>
The children will live this song<br>
Growing old, my children are carefree<br>
Just like I, in this big city<br>
They will be here, with their friends<br>
Their memories will never end<br>

	I'm tired of waiting in line<br>
For the world to be mine<br>
<br>
My life is on a wild roller coaster<br>
forever the suspense to reach the top<br>
Displayed elsewhere on every poster<br>
But so fast and quick the drop<br>
<br>
Moments of excitement on this ride<br>
seperated by challenges in disguise<br>
<br>
Like a carnival, can all be gone in a night<br>
Such as life, the house of mirrors and fright<br>
<br>
In the middle, there is a wishing well<br>
Hoping to escape my thoughts on this caurosel<br>
Around, Around, Here we go again<br>
Tonight I found, Here we go again<br>
<br>
Getting dizzy and bound to puke<br>
On an emotionless ride, mono-hue fluke<br>
Yet with amounts of saturation<br>
to fulfill momentarily satisfaction<br>

Roller Coaster, Drop Me Fast<br>
Carousel, Forver Lasts<br>
Ferris Wheel, He we go<br>
Convience Stands, Follow The Row<br></td>

That We Met A year Ago<br>
Awhile since I saw you last<br>

Twice we fell apart<br>
I Blame myself for all<br>
Tomorrow I'll Call<br>

You're my best friend<br>
Now in love again<br>
I give my love to you<br>
I'll spend my life with you<br>

Please Bring Me Back To You<br>
Last Night, I Thought It Through<br>

Last Summer at the show<br>
I hope this year you will go<br>
So what can happen once again<br>
To be with you, I'll ditch my friends<br>
Second time was a kiss<br>
You are mine, I will miss<br>
You are perfect in every way<br>
So Now Lets just go and lay again<br>
<br>
Bring A Smile To Your Face<br>
Take this at an easy pace<br>
Fill You with everything<br>
Don't stop Making my heart ring<br>
Game I Will<br>
Never Kill<br>
What We Had<br>
Losing Is Bad<br>

Last Night, I Thought It Through<br>
Please Bring Me Back To You<br>
Last Night, I Thought It Through<br>
I'll Bring My Love To You<br>

Maybe on this night<br>
We will shed some light<br>
Again We go at it<br>
I throw my heart in it<br>
<br>
Lose Myself in your eyes<br>
I wont give you any lies<br>
You've been in my thoughts<br>
Since the night we faught<br>
Keep Near to Me<br>
On my knees<br>
Pleading to you<br>
Can't Stop Loving You<br>

Last Night, I Dreamed of You<br>
Us together at 22<br>
Last Night, I Got A Clue<br>
You wanted me to be with you<br>

Last Night, It All Came Out<br>
I Just Want To Go And Shout<br>
Last Night, I Left It Out<br>

about to be'n... Last Place<br>

Now-the-years have passed, and that man was right<br>

Against all odds, in a challenged world<br>
Against it all, in a fearless world<br>

To Whom was I, to feel alone<br>
To Whom was I, to feel so down<br>

because...<br>
I want to wake, up in your arms<br>
instead of my mornin' alarm<br>
I want to wake, up under the tree<br>
Where at one time was just you and me<br>
And... I wish life, was only a dream<br>
so once i wake up, it is JUST you and me<br>
And... I hope that this, is not real<br>
but to go back then, is surreal<br>

Taking a walk, to your class<br>
A Goodbye kiss, never had to ask<br>

Picking you up early just to get to school<br>
Being wit you I never had to act cool<br>
Got you there in the nick of time<br>
A quick promise, that I am yours (and you are mine)<br>

Someone please save me<br>
Soul is drenched and weathered<br>
I cannot move on any farther<br>

What we had, what we did, and for what we have ,ever loved<br>

Drowning not so quickly<br>

Suddenly the rains gets worse, around me<br>
this time I cannot see<br>
the sun, this time, there is no light<br>

Drowned, this time completely<br>
Its too late to save me
Soul is drenched, wheathered<br>
My soul is drenched, and wheathered.<br>

Woahhh....		I lost this fight<br>
Woahhh....		Too late to be saved<br>
